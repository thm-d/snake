# What about this project

Generation 2000, we've probably all heard of the Nokia 3310 and its emblematic snake game. This little project (desktop version) has enabled me to continue to develop my programming logic and to get a closer look at the Canvas API, which is very useful here. The game adapts to all screen sizes and I hope you enjoy a few minutes. On your keyboards, ENJOY !
